-   Always start with a simple d2 diagram for docs.

    ````
    ```d2
    d2 code...
    ```

    ## Overview

    ...
    ````

-   Do not use custom styles or shapes for d2 docs.

-   Do not include content that is not relevant to the doc title.
-   Give a simple explanation of all the components described in the d2 diagram.

-   Write content from the perspective of a new dev who has to use the docs to add new features.
