# Climbing System Refactoring - Complete

## What Was Done

Successfully refactored the climbing system addressing all high and medium priority issues:

### High Priority ✅

1. **God Class Fixed** - Split ClimbingSystem into ClimbingPhysics, ClimbingCollision, and ClimbingSystem (coordinator)
2. **Long Methods Fixed** - Broke down complex methods into focused functions
3. **Code Organization** - Clear separation of responsibilities

### Medium Priority ✅

4. **Gravity Logic Consolidated** - All gravity management now in ClimbingPhysics
5. **Complex Conditionals Simplified** - Used guard clauses for better readability

## Architecture After Refactoring

- **ClimbingPhysics**: Handles gravity, movement, snapping calculations
- **ClimbingCollision**: Manages area detection and overlap checking
- **ClimbingSystem**: Coordinates between systems, handles state and events

## Benefits Achieved

- Better maintainability (single responsibility per class)
- Improved testability (isolated components)
- Reduced complexity in main system
- Eliminated code duplication
- Preserved all original functionality

## Validation

- TypeScript compiles successfully
- All original climbing behavior intact
- Public API unchanged
- Debug system still works
