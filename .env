# Admin API Key for server-side administrative functions (REQUIRED)
# This key is required for calling admin reducers like SpawnAllEnemies, InitializeEnemyRoutes, etc.
# 
# IMPORTANT: For production deployments:
# 1. Generate a new secure key using: openssl rand -hex 32
# 2. Update the encoded key in libs/spacetime/server/Types/AdminConstants.cs
#    To encode your new key: echo -n "your_new_key" | base64
# 3. Set the same key in your production environment variables
#
# Example key for development (matches the encoded key in server code):
